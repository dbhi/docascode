## Summary and conclusions

The list of supported output formats (as far as the author is aware) is listed in Table \@ref(tab:markuplangs).
Note that Static Site Generator (SST) is not a single tool, but it stands for a whole family of projects.

Most projects add custom extensions in the parser, in the generator and in the default template.
Hence, it is almost impossible to reuse the same source for multiple tools, or even for multiple templates using the
same tool.
Potentially, multiple templates could exist which provide the same features as the default, but in practice that is not
the case.

<!--
At first glance, Doxygen is not designed for applying custom templates to general purpose documents.
So, although all the desired output formats are supported, it is not a suitable solution for documents other than the
APIs and internals of software projects.
Nevertheless, in some use cases it might be feasible to merge output from Doxygen into a larger document/site.

Hence, the list of contestants is: AsciiDoc/DocBook, Pandoc and/or Sphinx.

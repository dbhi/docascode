# Introduction

Different types of content need distinct features, regardless of the main workflow being common to any documentation
product.
Hence, what kind of outputs we want/expect to generate needs to be defined first.
The author is mainly aiming at a system/workflow that fits six projects:
[hdl](https://github.com/hdl),
[dbhi](https://github.com/dbhi),
[ghdl](https://github.com/ghdl),
[VUnit](https://github.com/VUnit),
[VHDL](https://github.com/VHDL)
and
[IEEE-P1076](https://gitlab.com/IEEE-P1076).
All of them are projects related to the VHDL language, either in Academia, in the Industry, or in the open source
ecosystems in GitHub/GitLab.
The following is a list of types of documents generated in such contexts:

- Reference of a CLI tool (written in Python, Golang, Ada, C...).
- Tutorials and how-tos about CLI tools.
- Blog posts.
- Papers/Articles/Chapters, which are gathered in Reports/Books/Proceedings/Memos.
- VHDL libraries and IP.
- VHDL standard.
- Landing site.

Furthermore, on the one hand, most of the documentation is nowadays first read on screens (either a workstation, a
laptop or an smartphone).
Visualizing documents as web sites allows for dynamic and interactive visualization of data.
On the other hand, the most thoughtful and self-contained content is better read outside and offline, thus, in paper.
As a result, for any of the content types listed above (except the landing site) we want to generate two output formats,
at least: HTML (website) and PDF.
Some content fits other formats too, such as man pages or EPUB, but web browsers and paper are a need.

It is to be noted that in this analysis open source tools/projects are considered only.
This is because documentation for the target projects is automatically generated and updated using Continuous
Integration (CI) services that are public, and mostly based on OCI containers.
Using non-FLOSS tools, although possible, increases the setup and maintenance burden.
Moreover, a priori no vendor tool exists which can satisfy the requirement to generate all the outputs.

Last, but not least, the target is to find or compose a single workflow that suits all the types of documents.
As discussed along this document, it is currently possible to generate all of them, using different sets of tools and/or
accepting multiple feature limitations.
But, asking users (developers) to learn multiple tools and languages providing exactly the same features is inefficient
and is, thus, unlikely to succeed.
On top of that, it increases the maintenance burden of the documentation system significantly.

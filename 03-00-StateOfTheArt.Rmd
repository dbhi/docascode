# State of the art

It is to be noted that what can be achieved is not constrained by the markup language only.
Some tools and templates extend the capabilities of the standard language, while others miss some of the basic features.
As commented above, potentially any markup language can be paired with a tool and a template in order to generate any
desired output format.
However, we are interested in solutions currently usable off the shelf.

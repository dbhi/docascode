## AsciiDoc | DocBook

AsciiDoc is a document format semantically equivalent to DocBook XML.
Hence, the claim is that apart from the default HTML5 output provided by AsciiDoc tools, it is also possible to produce
PDF, LaTeX, man pages, e-books, etc. by using DocBook toolchains.
AsciiDoc tooling was initially written in Python, but it has been replaced by Asciidoctor, which is written in Ruby.
It has built-in converters and templates to produce HTML5, DocBook and man pages.
Moreover, it uses Tilt for templating, which allows users to customize the generated output without writing a custom
converter.
The default HTML5 theme is based on [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/).

### Interesting features

Overall, the syntax looks nice, clear and powerful.
It is to be noted that a built-in mechanism is provided for defining *blocks* with custom parameters and layout.
Those are named *delimited blocks*.
That's a powerful mechanism that, at first sight, allows users to extend the markup language and matching templates
without having to deal with the backend/generator.
That is, no Ruby knowledge is required, a priori, for creating and using custom *delimited block* types.

### Drawbacks

Direct PDF generation through [Prawn](https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn) is supported.
Unfortunately, due to the context explained above, LaTeX output is a requirement for the author, and this workflow is
not completely explained in the docs.
There are brief references to `a2x` (which uses either Apache FOP or `dblatex`) and `asciidoctor-fopub`.
Among those, `dblatex` seems the most adequate, because `fopub` requires passing XSL parameters or modifying the XSLT
for altering the PDF output.
There is also `asciidoctor-latex`, which defines an extended syntax to closely match some LaTeX features (mathematical
formulas and environments); it can generate HTML or LaTeX.
Still, the first class citizen in AsciiDoc seems to be HTML5 output, and much of the docs are focused on it.
Unfortunately, the author did not had time yet for trying the different alternatives for generating LaTeX output.
Anyway, ready-to-use templates for journal articles Ã  la [rticles](#rstudio) seem not to be available.

Regarding templating, multiple HTML themes are available and it seems easy to customize the CSS output.
However, the author did not find examples showcasing different templates with a clearly different structure/layout.
That is, themes or skins are available, but not templates.

## ReLaXed

ReLaXed is a tool written in JavaScript.
The sources of the documents are written in a custom minimal syntax similar to Markdown or LaTeX, supporting typical
features such as LaTeX-style mathematical equations (via MathJax), interactive plot/diagram generation through existing
JavaScript or CSS frameworks, etc.
Examples are really nice looking and modern.
Unfortunately, similar to *pagedown* or *paged.js*, this is a very interesting approach to avoid LaTeX, but it is not
suitable for the use cases with most complex typesetting requirements.

This workflow seems to be specially suited for people familiar with web technologies, which know nothing about LaTeX.
However, the learning curve for those who need to learn HTML, Pug, CSS and JavaScript doesn't seem to be easier.
